*CORINE Land Cover* (*CLC*) is a European land use and land cover classification system that provides standardized geospatial data on land cover categories. It includes an associated style definition, typically stored in formats like GeoPackage, which links land cover codes to descriptive labels and visualization attributes (e.g., colors) for consistent representation across GIS platforms.

The goal of `clc` is to support operations with CORINE Land Cover data, addressing the challenges and specificities it presents, particularly those related to its associated styles.

## Installation

You can install the development version of clc from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("josesamos/clc")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(clc)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
# plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
